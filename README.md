# Rails Bootstrapper

## Intro

Script to get a Rails project going quickly. This is very much in it's first phase where everything is hardcoded. In the future this will be a handy script with options and customizations.

Currently this script will:

1. Download and configure the latest stable ruby and node versions using `asdf`
1. Create a new Rails project called `podcast-site` with SASS as the style pre-processor
1. Add and configure Rubocop with some plugins
1. Add `haml-rails` and convert all ERB files to HAML
